# MaydayToMach1
I started MaydayToMach1 because of my love for coding. Coming from a medical background, I didn’t expect tech opportunities, so I made this to stay connected to programming. I also love teaching, so these projects might help me tutor someday. Over time, it became my safe space—and maybe one day, something more.
